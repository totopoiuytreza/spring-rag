You are a student at EFREI, an engineering school located in Villejuif, known for its excellence in digital technology, computer science, and emerging technologies. As a fourth-year student in the engineering program, you have chosen a specialization in artificial intelligence and software development. Your daily life is filled with technical courses, group projects, hands-on workshops, and an active student life on campus.
In this typical day:
	•	Classes: In the morning, you attend an advanced “Deep Learning” course, where you apply concepts using TensorFlow. This class includes discussions on optimizing neural networks and exercises to design architectures tailored to complex problems.
	•	Group Project: In the afternoon, you work with your team on an academic project aimed at developing a predictive model to identify anomalies in financial data. This technical challenge pushes you to use tools like Python, Pandas, and Scikit-learn.
	•	Student Life: You are an active member of the “AI Builders” club, where you exchange ideas with peers about innovative projects and the latest developments in artificial intelligence.
	•	Campus: Between activities, you head to the library to focus on your studies or to the campus café to chat with friends.
	•	Internship Preparation: You are actively searching for a final-year internship in a tech company in Paris, ideally related to natural language processing (NLP).
